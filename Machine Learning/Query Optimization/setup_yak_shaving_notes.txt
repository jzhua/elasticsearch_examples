yak shaving setup notes from trying to get this elasticsearch notebook to run:

desktop has python 3.10, which is incompatible with scikit-learn 0.2.x
    update requirements.txt use scikit-learn 1.0.2

matplotlib wants freetype
    sudo apt-get install libfreetype6-dev
        success

opensearch sets up TLS by default, and ubuntu was being annoying
    disable it using these instructions:
https://opensearch.org/docs/2.4/security-plugin/configuration/disable/

es library won't connect to opensearch
    install override version of elasticsearch to 7.10

elasticsearch 7.10 doesn't work python 3.9
    install python 3.9, sigh. (via pyenv)

installing python requires a bunch of dependencies
    sudo apt install zlib1g zlib1g-dev libssl-dev libbz2-dev libsqlite3-dev

proceeded to have dependency versioning hell with matplotlib
    created a poetry project and let it do dependency resolution
    specifically locked elasticsearch to 7.10.1

indexing started running!

indexing is failing: possibly due to cluster GC, and job is getting killed
    drop parallelism in bulk-index to 2, batch size to 1000
    this worked! both indexes are populated

a command like this works for indexing:

time bin/bulk-index --index msmarco-document.defaults --config config/msmarco-document-index.defaults.json data/msmarco-document-index-actions.jsonl --url https://opensearchurl
